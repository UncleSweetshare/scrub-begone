# scrub-begone
`scrub-begone.lua` is simple Lua script which hides the avatars of blocked players in the Street Fighter 6 Battle Hub.
# Prerequisites
`scrub-begone.lua` requires [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework) to work. Download SF6.zip from its [releases page](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework/releases) and extract its contents. Only `dinput8.dll` needs to be copied to the `steamapps\common\Street Fighter 6` game folder.
# Installation
Place `srub-begone.lua` in `steamapps\common\Street Fighter 6\reframework\autorun`. If this folder does not exist already, it can be generated by running Street Fighter 6 with REFramework installed. The script should run automatically when Street Fighter 6 is started.
# Thanks
Many thanks go to [praydog](https://github.com/praydog) and [all those who have contributed to REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework/graphs/contributors).
